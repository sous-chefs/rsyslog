* Added Chefspec matchers

## v.3.0.0 (2015-11-09)

Additionally the 'source' and 'cookbook' attributes in the file_input resource have been renamed to 'template_source' and 'cookbook_source' to prevent failures.
* Helpers for determining the service provider on Ubuntu have been removed since Chef 12 does the right thing with Init, Upstart, and systemd.

## v.2.1.0 (2015-07-22)

* Allow the server to listen on both TCP and UDP. For both set node['rsyslog']['protocol'] to 'udptcp'
* Move the include for /etc/rsyslog.d/ to the very end of the rsyslog.conf config
* Added the ability to bind to a specific IP when running the server on UDP with node['rsyslog']['bind']
* Sync the comments in the rsyslog.conf file with the latest upstream rsyslog release
* Change emerg to log to :omusrmsg: *vs.* on modern rsyslog releases to avoid deprecation warnings

## v.2.0.0 (2015-05-18)

Note: This version includes several breaking changes for Ubuntu users. Be sure to take care when deploying these changes to production systems.

* 49-relp.conf now properly uses the list of servers discovered in the client recipe
* Fixed a typo that prevented file-input.conf from properly templating
* Added allow_non_local attribute to allow non-local messages. This defaults to false, which preserves the previous functionality

* Properly drop permissions on Ubuntu systems to syslog/syslog. Introduces 2 new attributes to control the user/group: priv_user and priv_group
* Remove logging to /dev/xconsole in 50-default.conf on Ubuntu systems. This is generally not something you'd want to do and produces error messages at startup.

* Removed node name from the comment block in the config files.
* Added a new file_input LWRP for defining configs.
* Added support for chef solo search cookbook.
